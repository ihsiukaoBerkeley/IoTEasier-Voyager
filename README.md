## Voyager

### IoTEasier

### Product Description:
Voyager is a 5G AIoT module designed to facilitate the rapid deployment of industrial AIoT applications.

It connects to cloud servers via LTE-M1/NB-IoT using the standard MQTT network protocol, and is compatible with AWS, Azure, GCP, or custom servers.

Additionally, Voyager features GPS positioning for remote tracking of the moduleâ€™s location and status. Its built-in power sensing function, utilizing a current transformer (CT) sensor, can report AC voltage and current data, enabling users to remotely monitor equipment energy consumption and detect power abnormalities.

### Role:
1. Developed and tested STM32L4 MCU firmware for Voyager, ensuring seamless communication with Quectel BG95/BG96 module and NFC EEPROM
2. Led the integration of various sensors and equipment with Voyager
